<h4>The Spanish Omelette is the most tipical food in Spain. It's easy to prepare and cheap! You only need potatoes and eggs.<br>
You can add onion if you prefer.</h4>
<h4>Ready? Here we go!!</h4>

<h3>Ingredientes for 4 people:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Potatoes - 4 big potatoes or 5. It depends if you prefer the omelette more curdled or less.</li>
  <li>Onion - 1 unit if you want</li>
  <li>Eggs - Between 7-9 eggs</li>
  <li>Extra virgin olive oil - to fry the potatoes</li>
  <li>Sal - to taste!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps to make the Spanish Omelette:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>First, peel and cut the onion. The choice of cut type depends on the taste of each person.
    If you like to find pieces of onion in the Spanish Omelette, we must cut it in thick pieces, if you prefer that it goes
    unnoticed, we will chop it finely.</li>
  <li>Once the onion is chopped, we poach it in a frying pan with a little olive oil. While we cook the onion, we peel and
    cut the potatoes into blocks of the thickness that we want. We can also cut them into thin sheets.</li>
  <li>Heat oil in a large skillet. Once the oil reaches a suitable temperature, we throw the potato tacos.
    Cook until the potato is tender but, preferably, without becoming golden</li>
  <li>When the onion is tender remove it from the pan and put it in a large bowl. We booked it. Similarly, when the potatoes
    are tender, remove them from the pan and put them inside a wringer to remove excess oil.
    This done, we add the potato tacos to the bowl with the onion.</li>
  <li>In another bowl, beat the eggs with a little salt. Once beaten, pour the eggs into the bowl where we have the potatoes
    and the onion. If we wish, we can add a little more salt. We mixed.</li>
  <li>Put a little oil in a non-stick skillet and pour the contents of the bowl into the pan. Cook for a few minutes over
    medium heat.</li>
  <li>With the help of a dish, we turn the tortilla. We continued cooking for another few minutes on the other side.
    If desired, we can turn the tortilla several times to better control the cooking process. Once the tortilla is browned
    on both sides, we pour it on a plate and serve.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Preparation time:</h3>
<p>30-45 minutes. If you are hungry, It's better that you start to cook early!</p>
